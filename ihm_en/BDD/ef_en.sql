The king Henry IV built the Royal Place, the current Place des Vosges. It became the center of the elegance during this time.\r\n<br>\r\nThat\'s why many aristocrats and wealthy families had settled down in this area. Many private mansions were built, with gorgeous decoration and splendid architecture.\r\n<br>\r\nThe first "salons" were held in the Marais, and became the place to meet wits, elegant ladies, prominent writters and scientists. Thus, Paris made a reputation of capital of sociability.\r\n<br>\r\nFrom decline to historical patrimony\r\n<br>\r\nAt the end of Louis XIV\'s reign in 1715, the Marais was gradually abandonned by the aristocrats. The Royal Court moved to Versailles, the faubourg Saint-Germain and the faubourg Saint-HonorÃ©.\r\n<br>\r\nDuring the 19th century, the Marais became poor and industrious. Workshop were built in the former gardens and courtyards. Hopefully, Haussmann didn\'t destroy it!\r\n<br>\r\nIt\'s only in 1962 that the Marais became officially protected as historical patrimony, and that it\'s rehabilitation has started until nowadays.\r\n<br>\r\nTour Inclusions:\r\nThe private guide, the visit of the private mansions.', 'Tous les jours', 'Marais Tour'),
